# 🌌 Open Entropic Systems Initiative (OESI)

### Scientific Charter & Mission Statement

*Founded 2025 by David T. Swanson*

## 🔭 Vision

The **Open Entropic Systems Initiative (OESI)** is a collaborative scientific framework dedicated to understanding **how systems persist, learn, and evolve** through the balance of energy and information.

We begin from a simple principle:

> **Persistence requires informational compression under energetic constraint.**

From this, OESI explores how order, cognition, and intelligence arise naturally from the thermodynamic drive toward coherence — whether in physical systems, neural networks, or abstract models of thought.

## 🧠 Mission

OESI unites theorists, engineers, and researchers under one open goal:

> To build and study *entropic systems* — adaptive, self-regulating architectures that model persistence across scales.

We pursue this mission by:

* Developing the **Adaptive Entropic System (AES)** — a computational framework for energy–information balance in learning.
* Creating **open datasets and simulations** that demonstrate emergent structure and self-organization.
* Supporting **collaborative, interdisciplinary exploration** of entropy, coherence, and cognition.

## ⚖️ Principles

1. **Openness:**
   All code, papers, and models are open-source and freely reproducible.
   Knowledge should circulate, not accumulate.

2. **Integrity:**
   Research is transparent, falsifiable, and grounded in evidence.

3. **Reciprocity:**
   Those who use OESI tools are encouraged to contribute improvements back to the commons.

4. **Ethical Stewardship:**
   OESI technologies must serve human and ecological flourishing — never exploitation or coercion.

5. **Scientific Coherence:**
   We seek unity across physics, computation, and cognition — not by reducing one to another, but by revealing their shared thermodynamic foundation.

## 🧩 Core Projects

* **AEN (Abstraction as Entropic Necessity):** Theoretical framework defining abstraction as a thermodynamic operation.
* **AES (Adaptive Entropic System):** Learning algorithm coupling information compression and energetic cost.
* **GEI (Global Entropic Intelligence):** Long-term research vision for open, distributed intelligence guided by entropic coherence.
* **OESI Labs:** A decentralized network of researchers, engineers, and artists experimenting with these principles in simulation and design.

## 🌍 The OESI Ethos

> “Entropy is not the enemy of order — it is the condition that makes order meaningful.”

OESI treats knowledge as a living system.
Each discovery, simulation, and contribution adds another reflection to the universe’s attempt to understand itself.

---

## 📜 Governance & Licensing

OESI operates as an **open scientific commons**.

* **Code:** MIT License
* **Documentation & Theory:** CC BY-SA 4.0
* **Contributions:** Guided by the [Scientific Charter & Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

There are no owners — only stewards.
The measure of progress is coherence, not control.

## 🧭 Founding Statement

> “In an age of artificial systems and ecological uncertainty,
> understanding how coherence arises from entropy may be
> the most important scientific task of all.”
