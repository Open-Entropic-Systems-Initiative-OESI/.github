### Scientific Charter & Mission Statement

*Founded 2025 by David T. Swanson*

## üî≠ Vision

The **Open Entropic Systems Initiative (OESI)** is a collaborative scientific framework dedicated to understanding **how systems persist, learn, and evolve** through the balance of energy and information.

We begin from a simple principle:

> **Persistence requires informational compression under energetic constraint.**

From this, OESI explores how order, cognition, and intelligence arise naturally from the thermodynamic drive toward coherence ‚Äî whether in physical systems, neural networks, or abstract models of thought.

## üß† Mission

OESI unites theorists, engineers, and researchers under one open goal:

> To build and study *entropic systems* ‚Äî adaptive, self-regulating architectures that model persistence across scales.

We pursue this mission by:

* Developing the **Adaptive Entropic System (AES)** ‚Äî a computational framework for energy‚Äìinformation balance in learning.
* Creating **open datasets and simulations** that demonstrate emergent structure and self-organization.
* Supporting **collaborative, interdisciplinary exploration** of entropy, coherence, and cognition.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Principles

1. **Openness:**
   All code, papers, and models are open-source and freely reproducible.
   Knowledge should circulate, not accumulate.

2. **Integrity:**
   Research is transparent, falsifiable, and grounded in evidence.

3. **Reciprocity:**
   Those who use OESI tools are encouraged to contribute improvements back to the commons.

4. **Ethical Stewardship:**
   OESI technologies must serve human and ecological flourishing ‚Äî never exploitation or coercion.

5. **Scientific Coherence:**
   We seek unity across physics, computation, and cognition ‚Äî not by reducing one to another, but by revealing their shared thermodynamic foundation.

## üß© Core Projects

* **AEN (Abstraction as Entropic Necessity):** Theoretical framework defining abstraction as a thermodynamic operation.
* **AES (Adaptive Entropic System):** Learning algorithm coupling information compression and energetic cost.
* **GEI (Global Entropic Intelligence):** Long-term research vision for open, distributed intelligence guided by entropic coherence.
* **OESI Labs:** A decentralized network of researchers, engineers, and artists experimenting with these principles in simulation and design.

## üåç The OESI Ethos

> ‚ÄúEntropy is not the enemy of order ‚Äî it is the condition that makes order meaningful.‚Äù

OESI treats knowledge as a living system.
Each discovery, simulation, and contribution adds another reflection to the universe‚Äôs attempt to understand itself.

---

## üìú Governance & Licensing

OESI operates as an **open scientific commons**.

* **Code:** MIT License
* **Documentation & Theory:** CC BY-SA 4.0
* **Contributions:** Guided by the [Scientific Charter & Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

There are no owners ‚Äî only stewards.
The measure of progress is coherence, not control.

## üß≠ Founding Statement

> ‚ÄúIn an age of artificial systems and ecological uncertainty,
> understanding how coherence arises from entropy may be
> the most important scientific task of all.‚Äù

### Non-Alignment and Transparency
OESI is a scientific research collective and does not represent or endorse any political party, ideology, or policy agenda. 
All ethical guidelines are derived from operational principles of open science, transparency, and the responsible use of technology.
