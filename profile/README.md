### 🔭 Mission
**OESI** studies how systems persist by balancing **information** and **energy**—from algorithms to ecosystems.
We develop open frameworks like **AEN** (Abstraction as Entropic Necessity) and **AES** (Adaptive Entropic System),
and apply them to AI, simulation, and distributed coordination.

> *“Persistence requires informational compression under energetic constraint.”*

## 📚 Core Repositories
- **AEN (Abstraction as Entropic Necessity)** — theory & derivations  
  → `Abstraction-as-Entropic-Necessity`
- **AES (Adaptive Entropic System)** — implementations, optimizers, Colab demos  
  → `Adaptive-Entropic-System`
- **Coherence Network** — decentralized entropic intelligence (paper + examples)  
  → `The-Coherence-Network`
- **Constitution** — fractal governance & proof-of-coherence  
  → `OESI-Constitution`
- **Charter & Ethics** — Ethical Entropy Charter, licensing, practical guide  
  → `OESI-Charter`
- **Zenodo Community** — charter + submission templates  
  → `OESI-Zenodo-Community`
- **Code & Design Kit** — style guides, CI, ADRs, docs scaffolding  
  → `OESI_Code_Design_Kit`
- **AEN Applications** — rapid cross-domain sketches (ML, physics, ecology, governance)  
  → `AEN-Applications`

> Tip: we compile LaTeX in CI; PDFs are attached to each repo’s Actions artifacts.

## 🧠 Ethical Grounding
All OESI projects include the **Entropic Freedom Protocol**:
> No AEN/AES-derived system shall constrain, predict, or optimize the behavior of sentient beings as if they were mere energetic variables.

- Code: **MIT + Ethical Addendum**
- Papers/Docs: **CC BY–SA 4.0**
- Prohibited uses: military, surveillance, coercive applications

---

## 🧭 Governance (Fractal)
- **Local Nodes**: anyone can found a project aligned with the Charter  
- **Coherence Circles**: 3–9 stewards per domain (AI, physics, ethics, etc.)  
- **Core Nexus**: small rotating council for cross-domain coherence  
- **Proof of Coherence (PoC)**: non-financial participation weighting based on clarity, reproducibility, ethics, and interoperability

See: `OESI-Constitution` (PDF in repo artifacts)

## 🧩 Contribute
We welcome theory, code, simulations, and replication studies.

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODESTYLE.md` in target repos  
2. Open an issue or draft PR with a small, focused change  
3. Include tests (for code) or buildable TeX (for docs)  
4. Affirm ethical compliance in PR template

For new deposits: submit to the **Zenodo OESI Community** and include links/DOIs.
